# linear regression with Python
Python implementation of the linear regression with Gradient descent and Ordinary least squares

Regression is used to find the relationship of one variable to one or more others.In machine learning, the goal of regression is to estimate a (numeric) value output from the values of a set of input characteristics. For example, estimate the price of a house based on its area, number of floors, location, etc. So the problem comes down to estimating a computational function based on training data.   ie : yâ‰ˆf (x)

for the least squarred residual we use the equation
